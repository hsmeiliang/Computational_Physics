# Computational_Physics

Week 1: Installation of anaconda and symbolic python (sympy) for root finding, limit and so on.

Week 2: Introduction to python:  " for ", " range ", " while ", and " if - else ", list and array.

Weeks 3, 4 and 5 : Plotting in python: plot, density plot and animation.  

(Data analysis in python: " loadtxt ", "open", " write ", and " close ".)

Week 6: Finite difference for numerical differential (forward, backward, central, five points and so on).

Weeks 7, 8: Numerical integration: Trapezoidal and Simpson methods.

Weeks 9, 10: Numerical integration: Gaussian quadrature and multidimensional integrals.

(Application of numerical integration in Physics: classical mechanics, optic, and thermal physics.)

Week 11: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs, initial values problems): Euler and improved Euler methods, mid-point method.

Weeks 12 and 13: Nonlinear equations (single variable): fixed point method, binary search method, Newton (and secant) method(s), and the associated applications.
